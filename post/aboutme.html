    <p>
        I am a computer engineer born in Brazil, this blog is just for me to write and ramble about anything really.
    </p>
    <p>The only reason its hosted on the onion network its because its cool and I wanted to see how hosting a hidden service was done, which turned out to be very easy.</p>

    <p>As everyone, I am interested in a wide range of topics. Some of them are:
        <ul>
            <li>Privacy</li>
            <li>Free software</li>
            <li>Artificial intelligence</li>
            <li>Functional programming, even though i don't know much about it</li>
            <li>Low level programming</li>
            <li>History</li>
            <li>Literature</li>
            <li>Science fiction</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Languages I speak well: 
        <ul>
            <li>Portuguese</li>
            <li>English</li>
            <li>French</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
