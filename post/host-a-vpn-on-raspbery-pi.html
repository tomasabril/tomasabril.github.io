    <h2>Host a VPN on Raspbery Pi</h2>

    <p>A Virtual Private Network is a very useful tool to secure internet traffic when using a public or untrusted wi-fi. Remember
        that the administrator of the network you are connected can read all of your information sent through http and possibly
        even https if you accept any security warning.</p>

    <h5>Software and hardware used:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Raspbery Pi 3 B</li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">Raspbian Stretch</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.pivpn.io/">PiVPN</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>It turns out that configuring a vpn is not that simple if you do it by hand. The
        <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">Wireguard</a> vpn seems to be a good solution thats not too hard to configure, but it's not yet in the current Debian
        stable. So I decided to go for the traditional OpenVPN, the problem is that if you read the
        <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/OpenVPN">wiki page for it</a> you will see that it's a long process to get it working. Thankfully someone created a script
        that does everything that's needed, the downside is that it works only for Raspbian, Debian and a few versions of
        Ubuntu. But a Raspberry Pi is the perfect low power, quiet, not too expensive solution to keep running 24/7.</p>

    <h5>Preparation</h5>
    <p>The Raspberry has to be with:
        <ul>
            <li>Raspbian installed,</li>
            <li>ssh configured,</li>
            <li>a static ip address,</li>
            <li>UFW firewall configured.</li>
        </ul>
        This are some pages that may help you with these steps:
        <a href="./post/instalando-raspbian.html">Instalando Raspbian</a>,
        <a href="./post/Configurando-SSH.html">Configurando SSH de maneira segura</a>.

    </p>
    <p>
        For the VPN to work we will open it to the internet, so it is very important that everything is always kept up to date. Before
        doing anything update the system:
        <pre class="term">
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt full-upgrade
$ sudo systemctl reboot</pre> Now enable
        <a href='https://wiki.debian.org/UnattendedUpgrades'>UnattendedUpgrades</a>, this is a Debian package that automatically upgrades essential security upgrades. Even with
        this enabled periodically update your system to make sure you are secured, a compromised vpn server can be very dangerous
        as the attacker has access to your complete internal network.
        <pre class="term">
$ apt-get install unattended-upgrades apt-listchanges
</pre> In the file
        <pre>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades</pre> make sure the following lines are as follows:
        <pre>
APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";
</pre> Install the
        <a href='https://wiki.debian.org/OpenVPN'>openvpn package</a>.
        <pre class="term">
$ sudo apt-get install openvpn
</pre>
    </p>

    <p>New we are ready to get started. :)</p>

    <h5>Installing PiVPN</h5>
    <p>The installation should be very simple and guide you step by step with a terminal user interface.</p>

    <p>To get started run the command bellow:
        <pre class="term">
$ curl -L https://install.pivpn.io | bash</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        After it finished downloading the program will configure your ip
    </p>

    <p>Choose the user to run the server</p>

    <img src="https://tomasum.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/screenshot_2018-03-19_17-44-24.png">
    <img src="https://tomasum.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/screenshot_2018-03-19_17-44-43.png">

    <p>I you haven't set up unattended upgrades before it will ask you to do so now. If you already have you can skip this step.</p>

    <img src="https://tomasum.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/screenshot_2018-03-19_17-45-27.png">

    <p>Choose the protocol for your VPN, UDP is the default and works faster and better. Only use TCP if you are sure UDP will
        be blocked.</p>

    <img src="https://tomasum.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/screenshot_2018-03-19_17-46-33.png">

    <p>Choose a port to run your server, keeping the default is fine but if you want to better hide your server the port can
        be changed.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers#Registered_ports">List of TCP and UDP port numbers.</a>
    </p>

    <p>Choose the encryption key size. 1024 is too small, do not choose this option. 4096 is slower and uses more cpu, a 2048
        bit key is enough.</p>

    <img src="https://tomasum.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/screenshot_2018-03-19_17-57-56.png?w=739" />

    <p>Enable Elliptic curve support, only disable this option if you will use an old client software.</p>

    <img src="https://tomasum.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/screenshot_2018-03-19_17-58-25.png?w=739" />

    <p>If your ISP gives you a static ip address you can use it now, for home networks you will probably need a dynamic dns
        provider. A good one with a free plan is
        <a href="https://freedns.afraid.org/">freedns.afraid.org</a>.</p>

    <img src="https://tomasum.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/screenshot_2018-03-19_18-10-26.png" />

    <p>Choose the DNS provider for your connection, you can use the one provided by your ISP or another one from the list provided.</p>

    <img src="https://tomasum.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/screenshot_2018-03-19_18-13-24.png" />

    <p>We are done! but not quite.</p>

    <img src="https://tomasum.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/screenshot_2018-03-19_18-14-43.png" />

    <h5>Configuring The firewall</h5>
    <p>PiVPN automatically detects and configures ufw (the firewall). Let's check the active rules.
        <pre class="term">
$ sudo ufw status verbose</pre>
    </p>

    <img src="https://tomasum.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/screenshot_2018-03-19_18-21-21.png" />

    <p>
        Now we have to change the port forwarding rules (Port Mapping Configuration) in the router, each model has a different user
        interface so I won't show these steps here.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://portforward.com/router.htm">This website is a good resource if you don't know how to configure your router</a>.
    </p>

    <h5>Create client configuration</h5>
    <p>
        <pre class="term">
$ pivpn add</pre> This command will create the configuration file for the client. It will ask for a name and a password
    </p>

    <img src="https://tomasum.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/screenshot_2018-03-19_19-00-34.png?w=739" />


    <p>The configuration file is stored on
        <code>~/ovpns/</code>
    </p>
    <p>Copy the file to the client and you should be able to connect.</p>

    <h5>Client Software</h5>
    <p>To connect from a linux machine import the .ovpn file on networkmanager vpn interface.</p>
    <p>
        To connect from Android use the official OpenVpn client to import the file.
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.openvpn.openvpn">OpenVPN Connect</a>
    </p>

    <h5>The pivpn command</h5>
    <p>
        <pre style="font-size: 1.3em;">
